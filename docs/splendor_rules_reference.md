Key rules we enforce in Prestige:
- On your turn, choose exactly one action: take tokens, reserve a card, or purchase a card.
- Taking tokens: either take 3 different colors, or take 2 of the same color only if 4+ of that color are available in the supply.
- Reserving a card grants 1 gold token if available.
- If you ever have more than 10 tokens at the end of your turn, you must return tokens until you have 10.

Notes:
- Gold tokens (jokers) are not taken directly from the supply except when reserving a card.
